# Tutorial for Data Collection at CCB

This tutorial will walk you through some of the useful steps of
collecting data at the CCB X-ray facility. This is mainly intended as
a reminder of usual settings and options for the relatively infrequent
times that we screen crystals using a home source. 

### Things to note for processing data

If the goal of data collection at CCB is to process data in XDS
(i.e. index the collected data), it is necessary to keep track of the
following instrument settings:

- Goniometer:
    - omega angle
    - phi range (total range) and width (per image range)

- Detector:
    - 2Theta angle (swing angle of detector)
    - Detector distance
